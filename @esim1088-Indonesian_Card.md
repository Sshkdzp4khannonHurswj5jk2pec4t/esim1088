The Indonesian Card comes in various types, including traditional SIM cards and eSIMs. For those who prefer physical cards, the traditional SIM card can be easily inserted into your phone, offering seamless connectivity across the archipelago.

Whether you're exploring bustling Jakarta, pristine beaches in Bali, or remote islands in Raja Ampat, your connection remains strong.

Another exciting aspect is the variety of prepaid plans available. You can choose from basic data-only packages to comprehensive plans that include voice, text, and data. This flexibility ensures that you only pay for what you need, making it cost-effective for both short-term visitors and long-term residents.

For those who require international roaming, the Indonesian Card also offers convenient roaming services. This means you can stay connected with loved ones back home without worrying about hefty bills. Additionally, some providers offer special deals for travelers, allowing you to enjoy discounted rates while enjoying the vibrant culture and stunning landscapes of Indonesia.
