One of the standout features of the Iran Tourist Card is its flexibility. Depending on the duration of your trip, you can choose from various data packages. Short-term visitors might opt for a day pass, while longer stays can benefit from weekly or monthly subscriptions. These plans typically offer generous data allowances, ensuring that you won't run out of connectivity when you need it most. Additionally, many providers offer competitive pricing compared to purchasing local SIM cards, making it a cost-effective choice for tourists.

For tech-savvy travelers, the Iran Tourist Card also supports multiple languages, including English, Persian, and Arabic.
