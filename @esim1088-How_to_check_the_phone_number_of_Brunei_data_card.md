If you're planning a trip to Brunei or already there, you might have purchased a local data card for your smartphone. Whether it's a physical SIM card or an eSIM, knowing how to check your phone number is crucial. This number will come in handy for various purposes, such as receiving important messages or verifying accounts online. Letâ€™s dive into how you can easily check the phone number associated with your Brunei data card.

Firstly, if youâ€™re using a physical SIM card, checking your phone number is relatively straightforward. Turn on your phone and wait for it to connect to the network. Once connected, open your phoneâ€™s dialer app and type in the following code: **#123#.** Press the call button, and you should see your phone number displayed on the screen. Some phones may require you to press the â€˜Callâ€™ button twice. If this doesnâ€™t work, try restarting your phone and repeating the process.

For those who prefer using eSIMs, the process is slightly different but just as simple. Open your device settings and navigate to the cellular settings. Look for the option that says â€˜Cellular Planâ€™ or something similar. Here, you should be able to view the details of your current plan, including your phone number. If youâ€™re unsure about navigating these settings, you can always refer to the documentation provided by your eSIM provider or reach out to their customer support.

When choosing between a physical SIM card and an eSIM, consider factors like ease of use, cost, and whether you need global coverage. Physical SIM cards are often cheaper upfront, but eSIMs offer flexibility, allowing you to switch providers without needing to physically replace your SIM. Many travelers opt for eSIMs because they can quickly switch between countries and maintain their primary number.

Remember, whether youâ€™re using a Brunei data card or an eSIM, understanding how to check your phone number is essential for seamless communication. Always double-check the instructions specific to your device and carrier to ensure you get the most accurate information.
