The India 3 Day Card is your ultimate solution for hassle-free mobile connectivity during your stay in India. This prepaid card offers an excellent way to stay connected without breaking the bank or dealing with complicated registration processes.

The India 3 Day Card provides you with a generous amount of data, making it perfect for browsing social media, streaming videos, and staying updated on emails.

One of the standout features of the India 3 Day Card is its compatibility with both physical SIM cards and eSIMs. For those unfamiliar, eSIMs (embedded SIMs) eliminate the need for a physical card altogether. They allow you to download your virtual SIM directly onto your device, offering convenience and flexibility.

In addition to providing fast internet speeds, the India 3 Day Card also includes calling and texting capabilities. This makes it a comprehensive package for travelers who need more than just data.
