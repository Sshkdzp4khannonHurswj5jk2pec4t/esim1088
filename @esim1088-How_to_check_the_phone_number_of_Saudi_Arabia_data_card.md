When you're traveling to Saudi Arabia or setting up your life there, having a reliable mobile phone number is essential. Whether you're using a traditional SIM card or an eSIM, knowing how to check your phone number can be crucial for staying connected and ensuring that your contacts can reach you easily. Let’s dive into how you can check the phone number of your Saudi Arabia data card.

Firstly, it's important to understand the types of phone cards available in Saudi Arabia. You have traditional SIM cards, which require a physical chip, and eSIMs, which are digital SIM cards embedded into your device. Both options offer excellent connectivity but come with their own setup processes. For traditional SIM cards, once you’ve purchased and activated your card from any local carrier like STC, Zain, or Mobily, checking your phone number is straightforward. Simply dial **#100#** on your phone. This will instantly display your phone number on your screen. It’s simple, quick, and works universally across all carriers.

If you’re using an eSIM, the process is slightly different. First, ensure that your device supports eSIM and that you’ve successfully downloaded the eSIM profile from your carrier. Once activated, you can check your phone number by opening your phone’s settings. Navigate to the “Phone” or “Mobile Network” section, where you’ll find details about your active SIM card, including your phone number.

It’s also worth mentioning that some carriers may send you a welcome message upon activation, which includes your phone number. Always keep an eye out for these messages as they can provide additional information about your plan and usage limits.

In conclusion, whether you’re using a traditional SIM card or an eSIM, checking your phone number in Saudi Arabia is easy once you know the steps. Remember, your phone number is not just a contact detail; it’s your gateway to staying connected in a new place. So, make sure you follow the right steps to ensure everything is set up correctly.
